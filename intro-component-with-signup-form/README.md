## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned a lot from the content covered in the form. I'd like to ask you to please share any more simplified code if you have it.


### Continued development

I learn a lot by doing form validation. I still need to improve a lot, but it's rewarding to create, test, and see that it works. I used regex and plan to use it to check the email input with all those rules for the number of characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.
